# Parametric-Design-
Parametric design is a computational design approach that uses algorithms to generate and manipulate complex geometries. This approach allows architects and designers to explore a wide range of design options and variations quickly, enabling them to create intricate and innovative forms that would be challenging to achieve using traditional methods. Parametric design is not only revolutionizing the way buildings look but also how they perform, with designs optimized for structural integrity, daylighting, and energy efficiency.
